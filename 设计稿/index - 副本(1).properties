And with 6 nationwide prepaid card issuance and acceptance of one of the licenses of the Fu Group built a third party payment tool based business platform. "We would like to make the prepaid card 6 years ago accumulated a lot of offline business resources, set to the line." Zheng Junhao, chairman of Yu Fu Group, told the China business news reporter. Before the platform to do business platform, shopping, prepaid card "Yu Fu Fu Ka” business accounts for more than 90% of all revenue. "Our business cooperation coverage is very wide, Sinopec, Parkson, Suning, Wangfujing (15.690, 0.04, 0.26%), New World Department Store (11.570, 0.15, 1.31%) department stores, Dixon [micro-blog], Meikailong etc.. Equivalent to the upstream supplier wholesale products to us, we retail to customers." Zheng Junhao expresses. - after 6 years, Yu Fu has branches and networks in 28 provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and so on, and has an independent POS settlement network. Therefore, Yu Fu has become one of the 6 enterprises authorized by the central bank to have prepaid cards issued and accepted nationwide. The precipitation of prepaid cards reaches hundreds of millions of yuan per year. However, the main pattern of the group has always been B2B, which has been issued against corporate clients. Now, they intend to move into the personal market with greater potential, and move to B2C.Then, after the connecting merchants shopping card Fu Ka, Yu Fu Group in the individual market, introduced the main wedding market “Xi Ka”. "We have our own jewelry brand, the future, we will integrate the wedding market suppliers, such as hotels, cars, etc., to our platform." Zheng Junhao believes that the wedding market has a year of hundreds of billions of market capacity, while the industry is highly dispersed, which has great prospects. Now, Yu Fu in Meikailong and Suning Appliance [micro-blog] (11.060, -0.01, -0.09%) channels pushing Xi Ka, customers in the two businesses to Xi Ka shopping can hit 2% off. In addition, fortune has launched a joint bank card with CITIC Bank (6.110, -0.04, -0.65%)". These three products complement each other, to the credit card debit card can be automatic repayment, credit card consumption accumulation can be converted to "property card" points, "property card" integral as a credit card can be used in the consumer of gold merchants in Yu fu. - online merchant, Zheng Junhao said, Yu Fu payment has been with Sinopec (5.940, -0.01, -0.17%) on the electronic platform, can go shopping in Sinopec Yufu payment platform, consumers can recharge their card to the card and buy all kinds of goods through the bank. At present, Yu Fu online includes the purchase of air tickets, hotel reservations, travel, payment recharge, movie tickets, shopping malls and other services. - - "we want to focus offline resources online and to block transactions on our platform through third party payment tools," he said." Zheng Junhao says. --- compete for customers --- to do business platform, the left hand needs supplier resources, the right hand needs customer resources, are indispensable. Obviously, as a channel, negotiating capital from suppliers for better discounts is a huge stream of customer resources downstream. Today, regardless of the online and offline, customer traffic is scarce resources. Striving for customers is undoubtedly the first challenge. In this regard, Zheng Junhao said, Yu Fu will use its cooperation institutions channels to open up new customers, after all, Yu Fu to fight for new customers, but also the customers of these businesses. In addition, Yu Fu has also launched advertisements in the city newspaper and the Focus Media (micro-blog) building billboard. - at the same time, as wedding and travel markets are relatively new to the market, they need to be strictly screened for merchants. However, China market situation is complex, with direct in cooperation with Suning, hongxingmeikailong national chain, in order to further the three or four line of the city market, Yu Fu needs and local area of supermarkets, department stores, wedding related enterprises in cooperation, this is also a challenge to the Yu fu. "Regional brands often live well in a region, but as an outside institution, it is difficult to expand in different places." - - in order to win customers, the electricity supplier for the "user experience" can be described as painstaking. And Yu Fu as the face of corporate customers in traditional enterprise B2B mode, has been facing the electricity supplier "spoiled" customers, can service in place, but also a test of the operation ability of Yu fu. --- background - as of now, the people's Bank of China issued 250 third party payment licenses, of which there are about 90 Internet payment licenses."The two quarter of 2013, according to Analysis China third party payment market quarterly monitoring" data show that the top 7 companies (Alipay [micro-blog], caifutong, UnionPay online payment, quick money, remittance world, YeePay, IPS [micro-blog]) accounted for 97.3% of the market share. Although there is no indication that the central bank will tighten the third party payment license, but industry concentration is strengthening. Analysis of international business model - easy Research Institute - Comment "affair" borrow the accumulation of customers - Yu Fu group at the national electricity supplier trend, from B2B to B2C in Xi Ka market, for example, Yu Fu integrates the wedding market to provide "one-stop shopping" for the user, this convenience to wedding couples who are attractive. After a series of transactions and payment behavior naturally come naturally, from the future development of business models, is a good project. - - but want to make electronic business platform, obviously supplier resources and customer resources are indispensable, and massive customer resources is an important support for negotiations with suppliers. Yu Fu online want to quickly accumulate customers, in the electronic business platform to stand out, it is like the United States marketing Godfather Seth Gogh Ting said, as do people talking about products, become a group of black and white cows in the purple cattle. And how to become purple cattle, in our opinion, the best way is not "affair".</p><p>"Affair" refers to the original male and female adultery, now the affair has become a neutral word, refers to a person or thing is attracted by another person or thing, level of attraction is very deep and merging. Yu Fu group with key topics, key time, special region, and an important figure with the impact of current events and take on their promotion of product realization "affair", so that the rapid generation of relationship has lasting appeal between brand and user.</p><p>China's drinking water competition is very fierce, most companies are forced to market by hard advertising. The farmer spring but through the promotion of pure water is not good for health, to pure water and mineral water dispute, with the key topic of "affair" way of attracting national media participation, quickly brand into the minds of consumers. If Fu Fu, like farmer spring, through similar "affair" strategy, it may be more quickly in the competitive business platform stand out.</p>
